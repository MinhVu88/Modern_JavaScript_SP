            <p>I've been crawling on my belly. Clearing out what could've been. I've been wallowing in my own confused.
               And insecure delusions. For a piece to cross me over. Or a word to guide me in.
               I wanna feel the changes coming down. I wanna know what I've been hiding.

               Paranoid and to lie. Hate and fear and to do. What it takes to move through.

                <p>
                  The members of Radiohead met while attending Abingdon School, an independent school for boys in Abingdon, Oxfordshire. <br> 
                  Guitarist and singer Thom Yorke and bassist Colin Greenwood were in the same year, guitarist Ed O'Brien 
                  and drummer Philip Selway the year above, and multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood, brother of Colin, two years below. <br>
                  In 1985, they formed On a Friday, the name referring to their usual rehearsal day in the school's music room. <br>
                  Jonny was the last to join, first on harmonica and then keyboards, but soon became lead guitarist; 
                  he had previously been in another band, Illiterate Hands, with musician Nigel Powell and Yorke's brother Andy Yorke. <br> 
                  According to Colin, the band members picked their instruments because they wanted to play together, 
                  rather than through an interest in the particular instrument: "It was more of a collective angle, and if you could contribute 
                  by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool." <br> At one point, On a Friday featured a saxophone section
